# movie_grabber.py V0.03
### This version only currently will pull up the 10 newest submissions on [r/fullmoviesonyoutube](https://www.reddit.com/r/fullmoviesonyoutube/). At this time it does nothing else (but has the ability to pull up IMDb info with a slight addition to the code).


See requirements.txt for pip library requirements.

Requires **praw.ini** in the same directory to initialize. Use **praw.ini-example** as a guide for how to do this.

You need to have a Reddit account and register a [Reddit App](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/). Then you will need to use the app credentials and user credentials in your praw.ini file.
